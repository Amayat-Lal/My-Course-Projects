    <h1>ChatGPT</h1>

    <p>
        ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large language models, it
        enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and
        language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.
    </p>
    <p>
        By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history,
        gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $80
        billion.[3][4] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Ernie, LLaMA,
        Claude, and Grok.[5] Microsoft launched Copilot, based on OpenAI's GPT-4. Some observers raised concern about
        the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or
        fuel misinformation.

    <p>ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is
        fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning
        from human feedback.[6] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity,
        OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access the GPT-3.5-based
        version, while the more advanced GPT-4 and other features are released under the "ChatGPT Plus" paid
        subscription service</p>

    <p>
        ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid and unprecedented investment and
        public attention to the field of artificial intelligence.[8]

        Training
    </h2>

    <p>
        ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target
        conversational usage.[9] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from
        human feedback (RLHF).[10][11] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case
        of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement
        learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[12]
        These rankings were used to create "reward models" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using
        several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization.[10][13]

        Time magazine revealed that, to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence,
        racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to label harmful content.
        These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were
        exposed to "toxic" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as "torture". OpenAI's outsourcing
        partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.[14][15]

        ChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft
        built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost "hundreds of millions of dollars". Following ChatGPT's
        success, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023.[16] Scientists at the University of
        California, Riverside, estimate that a series of prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 500 milliliters of water
        for Microsoft servers cooling.[17] TrendForce market intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each
        costing approximately $10,000â€“$15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.[18][19]

        Features and limitations

    <p>
        Although a chatbot's core function is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. Among countless
        examples, it can write and debug computer programs;[24] compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student
        essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human
        test-taker);[25] generate business ideas;[26] write poetry and song lyrics;[27] translate and summarize
        text;[28] emulate a Linux system; simulate entire chat rooms; play games like tic-tac-toe; or simulate an
        ATM.[22]
