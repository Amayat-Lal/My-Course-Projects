        Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time,
        the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid
        rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a
        more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.
